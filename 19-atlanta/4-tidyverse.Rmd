# Tidyverse packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# cyl_plot()
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_bar(aes(cyl)) + 
  coord_flip()

# cyl_sum()
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mpg = mean(mpg))
```

* `create_package("~/desktop/tidytest")`
* `use_mit_license()` / `use_gpl3_license()`
* make two functions: `cyl_plot()` and `cyl_summary()`
* make it work - remember dependency stuff (`use_something()`, and `::`)
* get check passing as cleanly as you can
* GREEN post it when done; PINK post it for problems

---

* Remove calls to `library()`, and instead call `use_package()` once
* Use `::` or `@importFrom` to access the functions
* `@importFrom magrittr %>%` to access the pipe
* For data-variables we switch from `cyl` to `.data$cyl`
  and added `@importFrom rlang .data`

---

* Tidyverse is nice to use because it blurs data-variables and environment-variables 
* `{{ x }}` means looks for data-variable in env-variable `x` that allows you to easily use tidyeval inside a function
* Also `...` just works
